#### The main task in this assignment:
Your task is to fix the broken chatbot and write as many features properly as you can.

#### ðŸ¤– Instructions:
1. You should fix the broken iteration process:
	- Display the chatbot messages 
	- Allow to answer the questions asked by the **chatbot**, for example:
		- What's your name?
		- How was your day?
		- Where are from?
		- How old are you?
		- What's your favorite hobby?
2. Show each of your message in a blue bubble **`class="me"`** and the chatbot messages in a gray bubble **`class="him"`**.
3. At the start of a new chat (example: reloading the site), the button message should write: Let's chat, after that the text changes to: Send Message.
4. After the chat ends, you should disable the button.
5. Try to refactor and clean up the code as much as possible.

#### ðŸ”¥ Bonus:
1. Load the messages via **Axios** from a json file
2. Use **Composite API**
3. Be creative and add nice features
4. Add vue-typed-js for type animations
